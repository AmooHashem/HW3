#Hi!
let's setup the nginx
=====
copy this file (nginx.conf) to where ever your nginx folder is ((?)/etc/nginx/) and change the root for "/" route according to where you cloned the project (where the files are)
also mind the permissions and ownerships of the files to avoid 403 error to serve static files
